# cypress-testrail-reporter
This little tool will help you to parse and post cypress test results to testrail.

This repo is forked from [sumcumo/cypress-testrail-reporter
](https://github.com/sumcumo/cypress-testrail-reporter) as a temp compatibility with cypress v10.

Usage of this repo is exact the same as `sumcumo/cypress-testrail-reporter` except it read config from `testrailReporter.json` instead of `cypress.json` since cypress v10 use a js/ts config file.

## Preconditions
This tools works with Mochawesome Json Reports. So please make sure you have the following packages installed: 
```
yarn add --dev mocha mochawesome mochawesome-merge
```


Example Configuration of the Mochawesome Reporter (`cypress.json`): 
``` json
    "reporter": "mochawesome",
    "reporterOptions": {
        "reportDir": "test/cypress/results",
        "reportFilename": "mochawesomeReport.json",
        "overwrite": false,
        "html": false,
        "json": true
    },
```

This tool internally uses `@sum.cumo/Node-TestRail` (https://github.com/sumcumo/Node-TestRail) as Testrail API Client.

## Installation
```
yarn add --dev @arabyzy/cypress-testrail-reporter
```

## Testrail Case Ids
In order to link you cypress tests to testrail cases it's required to provide the actual Testrail CaseId(s) in your tests title.
Example:
```
it('should do something [123]', () => {})
```
Or
```
describe('Feature Tests [123]', () => {

  it('should do something', () => {})
  
})
```

The above examples will link the results of the test to a case C123 (C is the testrail Case Prefix. Case IDs are numerical)


## Config
The Testrail Reporter gets its config from your `testrailReporter.json` and / or provided cli arguments.

### Configuration via `testrailReporter.json`
Add a `testrailReporter` section to your Cypress Config. You can provide the following:

Argument                    | Description
------                      | ------
`projectId`                 | The ID of your Testrail Project
`suiteId`                   | Testrails Suite Id
`branchReferenceRegex`      | This Reporter will create JIRA References if this regex is matching your Branch name
`host`                      | The Address of your running Testrail Application (API)
`username`                  | A Username for Authentication against Testrail API
`password`                  | The corresponding password or API token
`reportFilename`            | The relative path to your mochawesome report, eg ./test/cypress/results/result.json
`includeAll` .              | Whether include all test cases to current test run, Default: `false`

Example:
``` json
{
    ...
    "testrailReporter": {
        "projectId": "1",
        "suiteId": "2",
        "branchReferenceRegex": "((feat|chore)-\\d*)",
        "host": "https://example.testrail.io/",
        "user": "some@one.com",
        "password": "YOUR_PASSWORD",
        "includeAll": true
    },
```

### Configuration via CLI Arguments
You can also provide the arguments `name` `password` and `host` within the cli like
```
yarn cypress-testrail-reporter --user some@one.com --password YOUR_PASSWORD --host https://example.testrail.io/
``` 

## Usage
As soon as your Mochawesome Report was generated you can execute the following
```
yarn cypress-testrail-reporter --name NAME_OF_YOUR_TESTRUN
```
This will create a new or update an existing Testrun with the given name and will report all results found in your Mochawesome Report.

### Attachments
```
yarn cypress-testrail-reporter --name NAME_OF_YOUR_TESTRUN --attach test/cypress/results/report.html --assets test/cypress/videos test/cypress/screenshots --assetsArchiveName CUSTOM_NAME_FOR_YOUR_ARCHIVE
```
This will create a new or update an existing Testrun with the given name and will report all results found in your Mochawesome Report.
Afterwards it will attach a report.html to this run and create an archive containing all provided assets and attach it as well.

## CI Integration

This Reporter is intended to be used in your CI / CD Pipeline. 

```yaml
Integration Test:
  scripts:
   - yarn cypress # Run your cypress tests
   - yarn cypress-testrail-reporter --name $CI_COMMIT_REF_SLUG --user $TESTRAIL_USERNAME --password $TESTRAIL_PASSWORD
```

The Example above will report result for the current branch and uses global variables for authentication. So you don't have to store credentials within your project and can use Gitlab CI Variables instead.
